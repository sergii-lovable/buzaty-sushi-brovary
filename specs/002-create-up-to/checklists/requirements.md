# Specification Quality Checklist: Up-to-Date Search Engine Fallback

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids mentioning React, TypeScript, or specific implementation approaches. Content describes SEO value, user experience for no-JS visitors, and business outcomes. All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are completed with appropriate detail.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 12 functional requirements are specific and testable. Success criteria include concrete metrics (7 days for indexing, 95+ Lighthouse score, 100% data parity, <50KB size increase). No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers needed - the feature scope is clear (update noscript content to match current menu). Edge cases cover data staleness, special characters, large content, and empty categories. Assumptions section clearly documents the Menu.tsx data source, manual update process, and no-JS user segment.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Three user stories cover the complete scope: SEO crawling (P1), no-JS user experience (P2), and long-term SEO performance (P3). Each story is independently testable and prioritized by business value. The specification focuses on WHAT needs to be achieved (complete, accurate noscript content) without prescribing HOW to implement it.

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… **PASSED** - Specification is ready for planning phase

All quality gates have been met. The specification successfully documents the need for an up-to-date noscript fallback without introducing implementation details. The scope is bounded (synchronize noscript HTML with dynamic menu data), success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic, and all acceptance scenarios are testable. The document is suitable for stakeholder review and can proceed to `/speckit.plan` for technical implementation planning.

## Next Steps

1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Implementation will involve updating index.html noscript section with all 45+ menu items
3. Consider automation strategy during planning to prevent future data staleness
