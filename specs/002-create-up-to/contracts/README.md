# Contracts Directory

**Feature**: Up-to-Date Search Engine Fallback  
**Date**: 2025-10-10

## Why This Directory is Empty

This feature does not involve API endpoints, service contracts, or inter-component communication that would require contract definitions.

## Feature Scope

The "Up-to-Date Search Engine Fallback" feature involves:
- Updating static HTML content in `index.html`
- Using existing data from `src/components/Menu.tsx`
- No new APIs or services
- No network requests
- No component interfaces requiring formal contracts

## Data Source

The menu data is extracted from the existing TypeScript interface:

```typescript
// src/components/MenuItem.tsx
export interface MenuItemType {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  image: string;
  category: string;
}
```

This interface is already defined in the codebase and is not modified by this feature. The noscript content is a static HTML representation of data conforming to this existing interface.

## If APIs Were Needed

If this feature required API contracts, they would be documented here in one of these formats:
- **OpenAPI/Swagger**: `openapi.yaml` for REST APIs
- **GraphQL**: `schema.graphql` for GraphQL APIs
- **TypeScript**: Interface definitions for internal service contracts
