# Feature Specification: Fix Menu Design Issues

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-menu-design`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix menu design issues: 1) add more space between categories list and products 2) categories items are overlapping on small-width screens"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Improved Menu Spacing (Priority: P1)

Users browsing the sushi menu need clear visual separation between category navigation and product listings to easily distinguish between navigation controls and content.

**Why this priority**: Essential for basic usability - users must be able to clearly see where categories end and products begin to navigate effectively.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by viewing the menu section and verifying adequate spacing between TabsList and TabsContent components delivers improved visual hierarchy.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing the menu section, **When** they look at the category tabs and product grid, **Then** there is visually clear separation between the two sections
2. **Given** a user is browsing menu categories, **When** they switch between different categories, **Then** the spacing remains consistent and visually appropriate

### User Story 2 - Responsive Category Navigation (Priority: P1)

Users on mobile devices and small screens need category tabs that don't overlap or become unreadable, ensuring they can navigate the menu effectively regardless of screen size.

**Why this priority**: Critical for mobile usability - overlapping tabs make navigation impossible on smaller screens, blocking core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by resizing browser window to mobile widths and verifying all category tabs remain readable and clickable without overlap.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is viewing the menu on a mobile device, **When** they look at the category tabs, **Then** all tabs are fully visible and readable without overlapping
2. **Given** a user is on a small-width screen, **When** they interact with category tabs, **Then** each tab maintains adequate touch target size and spacing
3. **Given** a user is browsing on various screen sizes, **When** they view the menu, **Then** category navigation adapts appropriately to screen width

### Edge Cases

- What happens when category names are very long on extremely narrow screens?
- How does the system handle landscape orientation on mobile devices?
- What occurs when users have very large font sizes enabled?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide minimum 48px visual spacing between category navigation tabs and product grid content
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure category tabs maintain minimum 44px width for accessibility compliance on all screen sizes
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement responsive layout that prevents text compression below 8px character width on any screen size
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain consistent spacing between navigation and content across all category selections
- **FR-005**: System MUST adapt category tab layout responsively to prevent overlap on screens narrower than 768px
- **FR-006**: System MUST implement text truncation or abbreviation for category names longer than 15 characters on small screens
- **FR-007**: System MUST ensure all category tabs remain fully visible and clickable without horizontal scrolling on screens as narrow as 320px

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Menu Category**: Represents a food category with display name and filtering value
- **Menu Item**: Represents individual food items with category association
- **Screen Size**: Represents different viewport dimensions affecting layout behavior

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can clearly distinguish between category navigation and product content with minimum 48px visual separation
- **SC-002**: All category tabs maintain minimum 44px width and remain fully clickable on screens as narrow as 320px width
- **SC-003**: Category navigation maintains consistent spacing and layout across all supported screen sizes without text compression below 8px per character
- **SC-004**: Touch targets for category tabs meet minimum 44px accessibility guidelines on mobile devices
- **SC-005**: Menu layout adapts responsively without horizontal scrolling or content cutoff on small screens, with text truncation for long category names
- **SC-006**: Category tabs display readable text with minimum 8px character width on all screen sizes from 320px to 1200px width

## Assumptions

- Current menu uses Tabs component from UI library with grid layout for category navigation
- Mobile-first responsive design approach is preferred
- Category tab text lengths are relatively consistent across all categories
- Users primarily interact with menu on mobile devices and desktop browsers
- Accessibility standards require minimum touch target sizes for mobile interaction

## Detailed Analysis Findings

### Current Spacing Issue
- **Current spacing**: 32px between category tabs and product grid
- **Source**: TabsList has `margin-bottom: 32px` and `padding-bottom: 4px`
- **Issue**: Insufficient visual separation creates cramped appearance
- **Impact**: Users struggle to distinguish between navigation and content sections

### Category Tab Overlap Issues
- **Screen sizes affected**: All screen sizes below desktop (768px and smaller)
- **Current behavior**: Tabs compress to fit container but become unreadable
- **Specific problems identified**:
  - **320px width**: 8 out of 10 tabs have character width < 8px (unreadable)
  - **375px width**: All tabs fit but with very narrow widths (50-61px)
  - **768px width**: Tabs are readable but still cramped (139px width)
- **Text readability**: Long category names like "ОРИГІНАЛЬНІ / ЧІЗ РОЛИ" (22 chars) compressed to 2px per character
- **Touch targets**: Current 50px width on mobile falls below 44px accessibility minimum

### Layout Analysis
- **Desktop (1200px)**: 10 tabs in 2 rows, 178px width each, no overlap
- **Tablet (768px)**: 10 tabs in 2 rows, 139px width each, readable but cramped  
- **Mobile (375px)**: 10 tabs in 2 rows, 50-61px width each, poor readability
- **Small Mobile (320px)**: 10 tabs in 2 rows, 50px width each, severely compromised readability

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Increase spacing**: Minimum 48px between tabs and content for better visual hierarchy
2. **Responsive tab layout**: Implement horizontal scrolling or dropdown menu for small screens
3. **Touch target compliance**: Ensure minimum 44px touch targets on mobile
4. **Text truncation**: Implement ellipsis or abbreviated text for long category names
5. **Breakpoint optimization**: Adjust layout at 480px, 640px, and 768px breakpoints
