# Specification Quality Checklist: Пузаті суші Online Ordering Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification successfully avoids mentioning React, TypeScript, Vite, or shadcn/ui. All content describes user-facing behavior and business requirements.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: All 28 functional requirements are specific and testable. Success criteria include concrete metrics (3 seconds load time, 95% success rate, etc.) without mentioning technical implementation. Assumptions section clearly documents constraints around Google Forms integration, payment handling, and delivery scope. FR-002 was added to document category tab layout behavior (5 categories per row with wrapping).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: Four user stories cover the complete ordering journey from browsing to order submission, plus contact information access. Each story is independently testable and prioritized by business value.

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ **PASSED** - Specification is ready for planning phase

All quality gates have been met. The specification successfully documents the existing Пузаті суші online ordering platform as a baseline without introducing implementation details or technical jargon. The document is suitable for stakeholder review and can proceed to `/speckit.plan` for technical implementation planning.

## Next Steps

1. Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
2. Or use `/speckit.clarify` if additional user input is needed (not required for this baseline)
3. Constitution compliance check will be performed during planning phase
